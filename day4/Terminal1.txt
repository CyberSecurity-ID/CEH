  Tests for the presence of the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor reported on 2011-07-04
  (CVE-2011-2523). This script attempts to exploit the backdoor using the
  innocuous <code>id</code> command by default, but that can be changed with
  the <code>exploit.cmd</code> or <code>ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.cmd</code> script
  arguments.

smb-os-discovery
Categories: default discovery safe

  Attempts to determine the operating system, computer name, domain, workgroup, and current
  time over the SMB protocol (ports 445 or 139).
  This is done by starting a session with the anonymous
  account (or with a proper user account, if one is given; it likely doesn't make
  a difference); in response to a session starting, the server will send back all this
  information.

  The following fields may be included in the output, depending on the
  circumstances (e.g. the workgroup name is mutually exclusive with domain and forest
  names) and the information available:
  * OS
  * Computer name
  * Domain name
  * Forest name
  * FQDN
  * NetBIOS computer name
  * NetBIOS domain name
  * Workgroup
  * System time

  Some systems, like Samba, will blank out their name (and only send their domain).
  Other systems (like embedded printers) will simply leave out the information. Other
  systems will blank out various pieces (some will send back 0 for the current
  time, for example).

  If this script is used in conjunction with version detection it can augment the
  standard nmap version detection information with data that this script has discovered.

  Retrieving the name and operating system of a server is a vital step in targeting
  an attack against it, and this script makes that retrieval easy. Additionally, if
  a penetration tester is choosing between multiple targets, the time can help identify
  servers that are being poorly maintained (for more information/random thoughts on
  using the time, see http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p=76.

  Although the standard <code>smb*</code> script arguments can be used,
  they likely won't change the outcome in any meaningful way. However, <code>smbnoguest</code>
  will speed up the script on targets that do not allow guest access.
