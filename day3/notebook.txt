#################### SCANNING ##########################

Scanning is the process of gathering additional details about target using highly complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques.

The main goal : 
1. Host Discovery
2. Scanning for open ports
3. Service and version controls/detection
4. OS Detection

Type of Scanning :
1. Network Scanning
2. Port Scanningfile:///usr/share/kali-defaults/web/homepage.html
3. Vulnerabillity Scanning


######################### Network Scanning #######################

1. fping
2. netdiscover
3. arping
4. Angry IP Scanner


### Host Discovery Tool :

FPING : uses icmp ot internet control Message Protocol to send icmp echo requests to host in specified subnet range, If there are sustems that can respond to our ICMP requests. Their IP address will be shown in result.
Example : 
# fping -c 1 -I eth0 -g 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.255 
OR
# fping -c 1 -I eth0 -g 192.168.0.0/24

# windows system fireball is on then it's create problem ::: ICMP protocol is not working at that case

#### Net Discover Tool :
uses ARP or Address resolution protocol to identify active hosts in a specified subnet range.

NBSP : It can only work in lan 

Example: #netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.0.0/24 problem with tool is reduce font size to see proper.


## Finding the MAC Address :
root@kali:~/Desktop/CEH/day3# arping -c 1 192.168.0.156
ARPING 192.168.0.156
60 bytes from e0:d5:5e:7c:a0:68 (192.168.0.156): index=0 time=382.656 usec

--- 192.168.0.156 statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received,   0% unanswered (0 extra)
rtt min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.383/0.383/0.383/0.000 ms

-> -c 1 is send only 1 packet in the system

### Angry IP Scanner : (https://angryip.org/download/#linux)

##################### Lunch Break ###############################

## Port Scanning : The port scanning techniques are designed to identify the open ports on a targeted server or host. This is often used by admininstrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify running services on a host with the intent of compromising it.

Tool Used :

NMAP (https://nmap.org/book/man.html) : security Scanner tool {TCP Protocol}
-> port - open;closed;filtered;Unfiltered;
-> Nmap bydefaul used SYN Stealth Scan 

Scanning Techniques :
1. ICMP Echo Scan/Ping Sweep : not port scan, it is host discovery technique incorported in nmap for identifying alive hosts in a given network.
Syntax:  nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24

2. TCP Connect Scan/Full Open Scan : it detects when a port is open by completing the three way handshake. It establishes a full connection and tears it down by sending a RST packets.
Total Port : 65535
1000 most comman ports
 
	Source ----> Destination
	SYN+PORT80 ----->
		   <------ Syn/ACK
	ACK  ------------->
	RST  ------------->

	Now connection stabilized between host and server 

Examples: windows server ip 192.168.0.176
	  linux server ip 192.168.0.174
Command : nmap -vv -sT 192.168.0.176 it scan only 1000 ports 


-vv Verbose mode
-st using TCP 

3. TCP Syn Scan/Half open Scan: This Scan runs default afainst a target machine if scan type is not provided. It works the same way as connect scan but here 3 way handshake will not be completed.
 
	Source ----> DeSstination
	SYN+PORT80 ----->
		   <------ Syn/ACK
	RST  ------------->

windows Command : nmap -vv -sS 192.168.0.176
Linux Command : nmap -vv -sS 192.168.0.174


4. Null, XMAS and Fin Scans: These 3 are similar to each other. The advantage is many a times they get past firewall and IDS. All three of these don't work against windows OS. These are special type of scans because they use inverse flag in packers while performing scan. They will never work against a windows host.

	Source ----> DeSstination
	0000000+PORT80 ----->
		   <------ ACK

# Null Scan : Will have no flag set on scan packet
windows Command NUll: nmap -vv -sN 192.168.0.176
Linux Command Null: nmap -vv -sN 192.168.0.174

# XMAS Scan : will have finish, push & urgent flag set (FUP) on scan packet
windows Command Fin: nmap -vv -sX 192.168.0.176
Linux Command Fin: nmap -vv -sX 192.168.0.174

# Fin Scan : will have Fin flag set in scan packet
windows Command XMAS: nmap -vv -sF 192.168.0.176
Linux Command XMAS: nmap -vv -sF 192.168.0.174

######## Null, XMAS and fin scan never works for window syste

5. UDP Scans : UDP is stateless and dosn't involve 3 ways handshake.it is often unreliable as firewalls and routers may drop icmp packets and may lead to false positive showing all UDP ports open

windows Command XMAS: nmap -vv -sU 192.168.0.176
Linux Command XMAS: nmap -vv -sU 192.168.0.174

### Faster way to do :git 
namp -vv -sU -T5 192.168.0.176
why T5 please refer this : https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html


6. Specific Ports: 
   nmap -p80,8080,8085 192.16.0.174 then nmap will perform scan only these port.
TCP AND UDP BOTH:
nmap -pT:21,25,30,U:53,2049,3049 192.168.0.174,176 -sU -sT


7. Service Version Detection & OS Fingerprint:
    windows7 -> 192.168.0.187
    Linux -> 192.168.0.109
    -sV : service Version scan 
    -O : OS finger printing
     
Command : nmap -vv -T5 192.168.0.187 -sV -O
	  nmap -vv -T5 192.168.0.187 -sV -O
  

8. Aggressive Scan: it is combination of :
	-> Syn Stealth Scn 
	-> Service Scan 
	-> Os Scan 
	-> NSE default Scripts
	-> TCP traceroute
	
	Command :nmap -vv -A 192.168.0.187 -T5
	-A for aggressive scan 

	Smb-os-Discovery(in output window)
	these are the scripts


9. IDLE Scan: it is a very effective and stealthy technique. the idea behind idle scan is to introduce a zombie to scan another host. this technique is stealthy because the victm would receive packet from zombie host, thus not able to figure put ewhere scan originated.
