// Day 3 start :: (Scanning)


https://grabify.link/ : used for tracking ip and others information 

social Engineering Attack :
	Tool : theharvester (enter this in the Kali terminal)
	Command : theharvester -d gmail.com -l 500 -b google -h 
	Explain : -d is domain which @ email you want
		  -l rate limit how many query search you want
		  -b  is for data source 
		  -h is for shodan search result

#################### SCANNING ##########################

Scanning is the process of gathering additional details about target using highly complex and aggressive reconnaissance techniques.

The main goal : 
1. Host Discovery
2. Scanning for open ports
3. Service and version controls/detection
4. OS Detection

Type of Scanning :
1. Network Scanning
2. Port Scanning
3. Vulnerabillity Scanning


######################### Network Scanning #######################

1. fping
2. netdiscover
3. arping
4. Angry IP Scanner


### Host Discovery Tool :

FPING : uses icmp ot internet control Message Protocol to send icmp echo requests to host in specified subnet range, If there are sustems that can respond to our ICMP requests. Their IP address will be shown in result.
Example : 
# fping -c 1 -I eth0 -g 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.255 
OR
# fping -c 1 -I eth0 -g 192.168.0.0/24

# windows system fireball is on then it's create problem ::: ICMP protocol is not working at that case

#### Net Discover Tool :
uses ARP or Address resolution protocol to identify active hosts in a specified subnet range.

NBSP : It can only work in lan 

Example: #netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.0.0/24 problem with tool is reduce font size to see proper.


## Finding the MAC Address :
root@kali:~/Desktop/CEH/day3# arping -c 1 192.168.0.156
ARPING 192.168.0.156
60 bytes from e0:d5:5e:7c:a0:68 (192.168.0.156): index=0 time=382.656 usec

--- 192.168.0.156 statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received,   0% unanswered (0 extra)
rtt min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.383/0.383/0.383/0.000 ms

-> -c 1 is send only 1 packet in the system
